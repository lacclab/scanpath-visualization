# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Multiple Comparison tab.** Shows a real scanpath on top, then a grid of
  model-generated scanpaths over the same text, and a similarity table scoring
  each model against the real reading. Until real model outputs are connected,
  the model scanpaths are reproducible, reading-like **synthetic placeholders**
  (deterministic per trial; a 🎲 Regenerate button re-rolls them). The number of
  models is inferred from the data; a "Grid columns" control sets the layout.
- **Scanpath similarity metrics** (`scanpath_studio/similarity.py`): **NLD**
  (Normalized Levenshtein Distance on the word-index/AOI sequence — the metric
  reported by Eyettention) computed for real, with ScanMatch / MultiMatch /
  Scasim registered as labeled placeholders. Table headers carry a direction
  arrow (↓ lower-is-better / ↑ higher-is-better) and highlight the best model.
- **Fixation-index range slider** to window which fixations are drawn and scored.
- **Metric-convergence plots**: NLD vs cumulative fixation index and NLD vs
  elapsed reading time, one line per model, computed over the full reading.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Renamed the project to Scanpath Studio.** The PyPI distribution is now
  `scanpath-studio` (was `scanpath-visualization-app`), the import package is
  `scanpath_studio` (was `scanpath_visualization_app`), the console entry point
  is `scanpath-studio`, and the repository moved to `lacclab/scanpath-studio`.
  Update imports and reinstall: `pip install scanpath-studio`.
- `requirements.txt` now uses compatible-release pins (`~=`) so the Streamlit
  Cloud demo stays on a known-good minor without drifting.

### Added
- Project metadata and docs: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CITATION.cff` (GitHub "Cite this
  repository"), and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- A demo GIF generator (`scripts/make_demo_gif.py`) and README animation/screenshot.

### Fixed
- Release pipeline no longer double-fires: dropped the redundant
  `release: published` trigger and added `skip-existing: true`, so a re-run can't
  fail on an already-published version.

### Internal
- Single-source the version (`pyproject.toml` reads `scanpath_studio.__version__`
  dynamically), so a release bumps one file.
- CI cancels superseded in-progress runs (`concurrency`).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Interpolated fixation heatmap** — a smooth, word-box-independent density over the
  fixations themselves (duration-weighted when the metric is duration, blurred with a
  numpy-only separable Gaussian). Selected via a new "Heatmap style" radio
  (Word boxes | Interpolated).
- **Saccade direction arrows** — an arrowhead at each saccade midpoint, rotated to gaze
  direction (accounts for the reversed, screen-space y-axis).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Simultaneous second scanpath** in the Animated Scanpath tab — two readings of the
  same text co-animated on a shared real-time clock (per-reading rebased `timestamp_ms`),
  with blue/red trails, per-scanpath saccades and current-fixation highlights, a legend,
  and an elapsed-time slider. Opt-in via an "Overlay a second scanpath" toggle with an
  independent trial picker; defaults to another reading of the same text (preferring the
  same participant).

### Changed
- Unified the two animation builders into a single `make_scanpath_animation`; the quoted
  playback time now equals the real animation runtime (one timeline source).
- Lowered the per-frame floor from 50 ms to ~16 ms (one 60 fps frame), making the speed
  slider far more effective at high speeds.
- **Interactive Plot cosmetics:** moved the trial-metadata field picker into the sidebar;
  folded the reading-time / word-count / fixation-count stats into the trial summary table
  as rows; replaced the out-of-box caption with a "Fixations in word boxes → N / N" row;
  single-click "Download HTML" (headless Chrome via Kaleido now only spins up for
  PNG/SVG/PDF).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Trial annotations** — per-trial favorites, tags, and notes held in session state, with
  JSON download/restore.
- **Trial filtering & grouping** — sidebar panel to filter by condition (Hunting/Gathering,
  difficulty, repeated reading, correctness) and by annotation state (favorites/tags).
- **Questions/answers panel** — reading regime, selected answer + correctness, and
  answer/distractor spans annotated with whether each was fixated.
- **Plot options** — background color (incl. gray), highlight + count out-of-text
  fixations, and color fixations by line.
- Trial metadata shown per-trial in the comparison view.
- **Synthetic ground-truth test trial** — a hand-built trial shared by the test suite and a
  new "Synthetic test trial" data source, so the visualization can be checked against
  documented expected values.

### Fixed
- Static image export (PNG/SVG/PDF) on Streamlit Cloud, which failed because Kaleido v1
  needs Chrome — ship `packages.txt` (chromium), add a browser-free HTML save format, and
  give a clearer error message.
- Bundled raw-gaze sample always filtering to 0 rows (it was recorded for a participant
  absent from the demo) — synthesize a raw-gaze path from a real bundled trial and add a
  regression guard.

### Changed
- Test suite grown from 85 to 114 tests.
